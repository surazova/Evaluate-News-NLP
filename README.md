## Project Summary

We will create a tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on various articles, blogs, or news-sources that they find across the web, using an API. The user will be able to discern informaiton about the URL source, such as: agreement, confidence, irony, polarity, and subjectivity.
